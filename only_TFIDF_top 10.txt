article on exercise for impaired - overweight - asthmatics. i just found the site through the article on breathing difficulty. my frustration is, what exercises to do with asthma? today i walked out of the door of the house to take a walk, a beautiful, cool, blustery, sunny day. suddenly i couldn’t catch my breath, my upper chest felt ’heavy’, and i had to go back inside and sit down for a while. i’m no exercise weenie, before a couple of bad accidents (car crashes waiting at stop lights!) i used to play softball, volleyball, basketball, even a bit of rugby, i was a dancer and a weight-exerciser, a bicyclist, rollerblader, tree climber. even today, bp is typically 110-120 over 70-80, heart rate is fine too. is this just asthma? what exercises can i do, safely? sure, we all get it, exercise is good for us. just which ones? lots of us with asthma would love help here. thanks.
